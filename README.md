## Things to Know âœ“

- Working with RSS.app wasn't as smooth as I expected. A lot of values (namely the article image) return a lot of HTML elements with them as well.
  This means that I'll have to filter the URL's out of the retrieved string (w/ regular expressions) which increases the chances something might go wrong.
  
- Due to the "intermediate" webpage that RSS.app has in trial mode, I can't open the the articles in a android webview. The counter in the webpage doesn't count down when I do.     That's why I choose to open the URL in the web browser instead.

- Due to the RSS.app trial there's also a limit on 5 articles received per URL.
